As far as testing goes, I was not able to get into much of load/performance testing.
At no point did I issue a 100 or a 1000 requests and see how the application handled
that many requests. Furthermore, I did not do much testing in terms of headers and parameters in
the hash endpoint or headers in the stats endpoint and would have like to have dived more
into this area had time provided. In addition, I would have liked to have asked and tested if
there were any validations around passwords, such as does a password have to contain 1 uppercase character,
1 special character, and must be at least 8 characters long and see if the endpoints validated against that.
Moreover, I would have liked to have tested passing in multiple keys in the POST response to
the hash endpoint. I did testing around the password key, but not adding a key in addition to that one. Lastly, I would
have like to have tested the actual error messages a bit more and see where they could have been improved from
malformed input and Method Not Supported.
